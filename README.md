# Creating Valheim Mods
This mod can be used as an example of how Valheim mods are created.

## Requirements

ValheimPlus, BepInEx, Visual Studio with .NET Framework 4

### Setup
Step 1: Download the latest release of [BepInEx_x64 zip](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)

Step 2: Extract the contents of the zip into Valheim's root folder.

Step 3: Download the ValheimPlus mod, and extract only the Managed folder into the valheim_Data/Managed folder.

### New Mods
Step 1: Open Visual Studio and create a new Class Library (.NET Framework) using .NET Framework 4.

Step 2: Add References to assembly_valheim.dll, BepInEx.dll, UnityEngine.dll, and UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll.

Step 3: Rename Class1.cs to [ModName]Plugin, and extend BaseUnityPlugin. This makes the class into an injected MonoBehaviour.
